# Books

Here is a curated list of useful books to learn Coq.

- [Coq'art](https://www.labri.fr/perso/casteran/CoqArt/) (Yves Bertot, Pierre Castéran) is the first book dedicated to the Coq Proof assistant and its underlying theory. Only the french version and the [sources and exercices](https://github.com/coq-community/coq-art) are free. The english version can purchased from the [Springer website](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-662-07964-5)
- [Software Foundations](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/) (Benjamin Pierce et al., 2007, with regular updates), a series of Coq-based textbooks on logic, functional programming and foundations of programming languages , much acclaimed for being accessible to beginners, but rather oriented to computer scientists.
- [Certified Programming with Dependent Types](http://adam.chlipala.net/cpdt/) (Adam Chlipala, 2008), a textbook about practical engineering with Coq, teaches advanced practical tricks and a very specific style of proof.
- [Mathematical Components](https://math-comp.github.io/mcb/) (Assia Mahboubi and Enrico Tassi, 2018), a book that is more oriented towards mathematically inclined users, to dive into Coq with the SSReflect proof language, and the Mathematical Components library.
